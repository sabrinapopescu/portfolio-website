          <h3>My role</h3>
          <p>I defined the main principles for the brand based on the project brief.
            To get client buy-in, I put together a detailed set of brand guidelines, including mission statement, values, logo construction, colors, and typography.</p>
          <p>After this, I defined the app features and formulated the JTDB to help me build the user flows for the app.
            I used the crazy eights method to sketch out distinct ideas for the product page and the check-out flow. </p>
          <p>Finally, I built mid-fidelity designs for the check-out flow and tested it with 6 participants. The user testing sessions helped me iterate and improve the designs for the high-fidelity version of the app.</p>

          <h1>5W's</h1>
          <p>Through this exercise, I dug deep into user insights that I used to formulate the user stories and features for my e-commerce app.</p>
          <h4>User Stories</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>As a new customer, I want there to be a variety of payment options, so that I can choose the payment method that suits me best.</li>
            <li>As a frequent customer, I want to see recommendations of products I may like, so that I find items I might not otherwise on my own.</li>
            <li>As a returning customer, I want to see an overview of my previous activity, so that I can view the search history.</li>
            <li>As a potential customer, I want to see what other customers have said about products and how they have rated them, so I can better judge whether the item is right for me.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Users</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>New customers who want to shop without creating an account</li>
            <li>Frequent customers who want to see recommendations for products in the same category</li>
            <li>Returning customers who want an overview of previous activities</li>
            <li>Potential customers who look for points of social proof</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div>
          <div>
            <h4>Who</h4>
            <p>people who want to shop for key items without going into a physical store.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h4>What</h4>
            <p>A responsive web app that shows users the inventory and allows them to purchase without signing up.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h4>When</h4>
            <p>This product will be used on commutes to and from work, in the evenings, during
              breaks, and on weekends.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h4>Where</h4>
            <p>Users can easily shop from anywhere they can connect to the internet, whether on a mobile device or
              on a desktop.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h4>Why</h4>
            <p>Users don’t have the time or ability to visit physical stores and would rather buy their goods on the go
              or from home. It’s also more convenient to try out the items and easily return those that aren’t desired or appropriate without having to return to a physical store.</p>

          <h3>Define</h3>
          <h1>Brand guidelines</h1>
          <p>For this e-commerce app for cycling apparel, I knew speed and movement were a feeling that I would like to translate into the logo of the brand. That’s how I ended up with the skewed text and slanted rectangles. </p>
          <p>For colors and typography, I wanted to evoke simplicity and confidence, so I went with more neutral tones and one accent color for buttons - orange.</p>

          <h3>Develop</h3>
          <h1>Sketches</h1>
          <p>I took the user flow to the next step and sketched basic ideas for the homepage, cart page, and product page. </p>
          <p>I decided to go for recognizable patterns in terms of layout and product cards.
            In terms of navigation for the product page, I wanted as much visibility over the features as possible, for a simpler and easier user experience.</p>
          <p>With these sketches, I moved straight to mid-fidelity designs and built the MVP version of the screens for the user testing phase. </p>

          <p>With a mid-fidelity design of the add-to-cart flow, I put together a prototype for user testing. I asked six participants to test the prototype of my screens. </p>
          <p>I had over 45 comments, and what you will see is a selection of them, which helped me design the final version of these screens. </p>
          <h4>I centered my design decisions around: </h4>
          <ul>
            <li>How to visually prioritize the customer review section </li>
            <li>How to visually make product information more digestible</li>

          <h4>What went well</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Designing solutions for the chosen features: I managed to implement all the ideas that complement the features, as well as bring a few additional edge cases for the product page</li>
            <li>Brand guidelines: I am happy with the guidelines that I have defined for this project. It’s extensive and executed so that it can be accessible to any team member</li>
            <li>User feedback: Getting feedback from the right people helped me understand user pains from similar apps and focus on simplicity. This is why I implemented horizontal scrolling for a lot of the sections → to make the experience
              accessible and the screen uncluttered </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h4>What didn't go well</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Looking back, I would have liked to cover some key accessibility points. Elements such as labels on the colors, or text labels for error boxes matter in design, especially when the shopping experience differs from one person to
              another
            </li>

          <h4>Ideas for next steps</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>From a business perspective, I would love to add on this project and work on some specific goals, such as:</li>
            <li>
              <ul>
                <li>how to incentivize customers to review their products</li>
                <li>how to reduce the number of returned orders </li>
                <li>knowing that today’s tech leaders focusing more on rolling out video features, how can this product improve its metrics using more visual content?)</li>
              </ul>
